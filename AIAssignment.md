I used AI to speed up development, integration betwen interplaying parts of the project, and assist with debugging manner.

The AI performed pretty well in this project. It didn't have significant hallucinations. I was able to adapt a significant part of it into my work.

One thing the AI did that I was a bit unfamiliar with is the jest unit testing framework. I've never used Jest before in TS development, I mainly used vitest and playwright. However, after researching Jest, it seems very similar to vitest and playwright -- it is a testing library for the JS ecosystem that support test running, assertions, and mocking dependencies. Pretty cool framework overall I will be sure to try it out in future personal projects too!
